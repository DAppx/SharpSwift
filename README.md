The following are brief descriptions of the technologies used
##MVVM


##Networking
###[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
Rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface.
This is a Swift version of Rx.

### [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
Elegant HTTP Networking in Swift

### [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya)
Network abstraction layer written in Swift.
Moya provides reactive extensions for ReactiveCocoa and RxSwift.

### [Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo)
Functional JSON parsing library for Swift
Argo is a library that lets you extract models from JSON or similar structures in a way that's concise, type-safe, and easy to extend. Using Argo, you won't need to write validation code to ensure that incoming data is of the right type, or to make sure required data fields aren't turning up empty. Argo uses Swift's expressive type system to do that for you, and reports back explicit failure states in case it doesn't find what you've told it to expect

##Dependency Injector
###[Swinject](https://github.com/androidannotations/androidannotations)
 a lightweight dependency injection framework for Swift.
Dependency injection (DI) is a software design pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies. In the pattern, Swinject helps your app split into loosely-coupled components, which can be developed, tested and maintained more easily. Swinject is powered by the Swift generic type system and first class functions to define dependencies of your app simply and fluently.

## LayOut
### [SnapKit](https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit)
A Swift Autolayout DSL for iOS & OS X

##O/R Mapping ,DB,NoSQL
### [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper)
Simple JSON Object mapping written in Swift
ObjectMapper is a framework written in Swift that makes it easy for you to convert your model objects (classes and structs) to and from JSON.

###[Realm Swift ](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#installation)
Realm Swift enables you to efficiently write your appâ€™s model layer in a safe, persisted and fast way

## Pub/Sub




##Logger


##Image Loader
###[Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)
Kingfisher is a lightweight, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web. This project is heavily inspired by the popular SDWebImage. It provides you a chance to use a pure-Swift alternative in your next app.
